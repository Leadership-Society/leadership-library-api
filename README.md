# Leadership Library
A Web API for the Leadership Library using ExpressJS and Mongoose.

## Features
At the moment, the API only supports retrieving books in the database, and users making new requests to loan a book.

In the future, it will support creating loan requests in the database, and functionality to log loaning and returning a book. It will also support users posting reviews for books.
